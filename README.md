# grocery-inventory

Grocery inventory is a simple web app made as a learning experience, being one of my first apps made with Express and Nodejs.
[The site can be found here](https://grocery-inventory-dyfi.onrender.com/). The password to create, delete and update items and categories is currently an environment variable set as password.
